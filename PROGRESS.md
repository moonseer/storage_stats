## Recent Fixes (March 25, 2025)

The application is now working properly with all critical issues resolved:

1. **Segmentation Fault** - Fixed signal connection issues in the MainWindow
2. **File Size Display** - Fixed file size calculation and display, showing correct units
3. **Method Name Mismatches** - Fixed inconsistencies in method names across the codebase
4. **Dictionary Access Pattern** - Improved handling of dictionary access
5. **UI Component References** - Fixed references to non-existent UI components

## Recent Testing Improvements (March 28, 2025)

The application now has comprehensive testing capabilities:

1. **Test Structure** - Created a complete test structure with unit, integration, and UI tests
2. **Helper Functions** - Added thorough tests for core utilities like human_readable_size
3. **Scanner Tests** - Implemented tests for the file system scanner functionality
4. **Analyzer Tests** - Created tests for the data analysis components
5. **UI Testing** - Added tests for UI components like the dashboard view
6. **Integration Tests** - Implemented tests that verify different components work together correctly
7. **Test Runner** - Added a convenient script to run different types of tests

## Next Steps

1. Complete performance testing
2. Develop user manual and comprehensive documentation
3. Create installation package and distribution mechanism
4. Consider adding more visualization options (charts/graphs)
5. Add file actions with proper permissions handling
